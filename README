P-HOTPANTS
==========

Main contribution

we accelerate the online-available image subtraction package "HOTPANTS" (http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/becker/v2.0/c_software.html) on one GPU and one CPU, and try our best to achieve the best performance. 

In P-HOTPANTS, we use GPU to conduct most computation and CPU to check or make decisions. In the most time-consuming part, Convolving, we use both CPU and GPU and achieve an overall 4 times speedup on a desktop with an Intel i7 CPU and an NVIDIA GTX580 GPU.

We focus on image subtraction procedure, thus remove extractkern.c, extractkernOnes.c and maskim.c in the orignial source files.

==========

File description

gpu_kernel.cu contains several computation-intensified functions, originally located in alard.c. 
Both GPU kernel and GPU memory allocation can be found in gpu_kernel.cu. 
The part in functions.c is more related to checking and turning. 
main.c controls the entire program, i.e. Input, Filling, Checking, Convolving and Output five steps. 
Global variables for .c and .cu files is in global.h and gforg.h, respectively.

==========

Compile

Both HOTPANTS and P-HOTPANTS were developed on Linux. Other operating systems may
require minor changes to the source code. Synthetic image is not recommended for inputs.

Modify the CFITIOS and CUTIL direction in MAKEFILE before conduct “make”.

Modify the GPU-PART parameter in gpu_kernel.cu to set the ratio of GPU workload in Convolving.

==========

Sample

we provide one 1K x 1K and one 3K x 3K image are input, please use the following commands:

./hotpants -inim input_3K.fit -tmplim templ_3K.fit -outim resd_3K.fit -v 0

or 

./hotpants -inim input_1K.fit -tmplim templ_1K.fit -outim resd_1K.fit -v 0

Contact

The program on GPU in P-HOTPANTS  was mainly written by Yan Zhao. It is strongly recommended to install the serail version first before this progect.
